# MatchMass
Compare your experimental data from mass spectrometry with a table of theoretical m/z values to quickly find out which molecules and ions of interest are really present in the sample.

The online tool for matching experimental and theoretical m/z values was developed during the chemical research focused to study mechanism of macrocyclization reactions.

All the details are explained in the app itself and can be found at: 

Main application file in the repository is MatchMass.py. Other files contains additional content and data.
